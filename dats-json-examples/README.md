# DATS JSON Examples

This directory contains early examples of encoding various GTEx, TOPMed, and AGR datasets into the DATS
model. These examples were used to guide the development of the metadata mapping code in this repository
but the current mappings may differ somewhat from what is represented here. Please refer to the most 
recently-released BDBag in https://github.com/dcppc/crosscut-metadata/tree/master/releases and the most 
recent code release at https://github.com/dcppc/crosscut-metadata/releases for the current DATS mappings.
