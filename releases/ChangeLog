0.2 (May 21 2018)
 -KC7 internal-only v0.2 release of KC7 crosscut metadata model for GTEx v7 public RNA-Seq metadata.
 -RNA extract Materials are now linked to the top-level Dataset via the 'isAbout' attribute.
 -New DataAnalysis objects are now linked to Datasets via the 'producedBy' attribute.
 -All applicable object types now have @id and @context properties.
  -Access objects do not have an @id property because it is missing from the JSON schema.
  -JSON-LD contexts have only been defined for a subset of the DATS object types.
  -See https://github.com/datatagsuite/schema and https://github.com/datatagsuite/context
 -GTEx subject Materials now use characteristics, not extraProperties, to store gender, age range, etc.
  -The corresponding CV definitions, which used to be in characteristics, have been removed, 
   as they are arguably part of the crosscut metadata model, but not the metadata _instance_ per se.
