0.2 (May 31 2018)
 -v0.2 release of KC7 crosscut metadata model for GTEx v7 public RNA-Seq metadata and TOPMed 
   public metadata for a single sample study, phs000946.v3
 -RNA extract Materials are now linked to the top-level Dataset via the 'isAbout' attribute.
 -New DataAnalysis objects are now linked to Datasets via the 'producedBy' attribute.
 -All applicable object types now have @id and @context properties.
  -JSON-LD contexts have only been defined for a subset of the DATS object types.
  -See https://github.com/datatagsuite/schema and https://github.com/datatagsuite/context
 -GTEx subject Materials now use characteristics, not extraProperties, to store gender, age range, etc.
  -The corresponding CV definitions, which used to be in characteristics, have been removed, 
   as they are arguably part of the crosscut metadata model, but not the metadata _instance_ per se.
 -The extraProperties property is now used to store the original, un-harmonized metadata.
 -The public DATS JSON for TOPMed study phs000946.v3 was constructed by picking values from the
   publicly-available dbGaP variable summaries to produce a single "dummy" subject/sample entry.
  -For numeric values the median value was picked.
  -For enumerated types the most common value was picked, with ties broken alphanumerically.
 -The Python script that produces the TOPMed DATS JSON can also be run on the access restricted
   metadata (not included in this distribution), in which case it will produce DATS JSON for
   the actual metadata, and not dummy values based on the variable summaries.
	
0.1 (May 4 2018)
 -Initial KC7 internal-only release of KC7 crosscut metadata model for GTEx v7 public RNA-Seq metadata.
 -DATS JSON files validate against https://github.com/biocaddie/WG3-MetadataSpecifications master branch
 -DATS JSON files do NOT validate against current (v2.2) DATS release
 -This is a preview release for internal consumption only and it is subject to change.
