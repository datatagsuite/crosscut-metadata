v0.2 Release Notes

This release is a KC7 internal-only release of the KC7 crosscut metadata model instance for GTEx v7 public RNA-Seq metadata.
Note that although the DATS JSON files have been validated against the JSON schemas in the master branch of 
https://github.com/biocaddie/WG3-MetadataSpecifications, they will NOT validate against the current (v2.2) DATS
release. This is a preview release for internal consumption only and it is subject to change.

  A copy of this file.

metadata/annotations/datasets/gtex_v7_rnaseq.json
  A single DATS JSON file that represents the parent RNA-Seq Dataset (for the public GTEx v7 data only) and 
  the individual sub-Datasets/data files associated with it (e.g., gene read counts, exon read counts, TPMs)
  That Dataset is linked in turn to the RNA extracts (represented by DATS Materials) that were sequenced 
  and analyzed as part of the RNA-Seq analysis protocol.
