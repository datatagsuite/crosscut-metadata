v0.3 Release Notes

This is the v0.3 release of the KC7 crosscut metadata model instance for the following datasets:

   -GTEx v7 public RNA-Seq metadata
   -TOPMed public metadata for a single study, phs000946.v3
   -MGI C57BL/6J reference genome, annotation, and human orthologs

The TOPMed instance includes only the public metadata for a single sample study, phs000946.v3, but 
the Python scripts used to generate this release may also be run on dbGAP access-restricted metadata 
for phs000946.v3, in which case they will produce DATS JSON for the actual (meta)data. Note that
the public TOPmed instance is generated by using the public dbGaP variable summaries to produce a 
single "dummy" subject and sample in which attribute values are chosen according to which occurs 
most commonly in the data (i.e., the median for numeric values.) This produces synthetic data and
may result in nonsensical combinations of attribute values, but has the advantage that it produces 
a metadata instance that is syntactically correct and may be freely distributed.

Also note that although the DATS JSON files have been validated against the JSON schemas in the master 
branch of https://github.com/biocaddie/WG3-MetadataSpecifications, they will NOT necessarily validate 
against the current (v2.2) DATS release. A fork of the DATS schemas and JSON-LD context files has
been created at the following URI for use in this specific project:

For more information on the crosscut metadata model and the DATS JSON-LD encoding please see the 
README.md at https://github.com/dcppc/crosscut-metadata

The following files can be found in the v0.3 BDBag:

data/docs/ChangeLog       
  ChangeLog for the crosscut metadata model instance.

data/docs/RELEASE_NOTES  
  A copy of this file.

data/datasets/MGD_GRCm38-C57BL6J_public.json
  A single DATS JSON file that represents the MGI C57BL/6J reference genome, annotation, and human orthologs.

data/datasets/GTEx_v7_rnaseq_public.json
  A single DATS JSON file that represents the parent RNA-Seq Dataset (for the public GTEx v7 data only) and 
  the individual sub-Datasets/data files associated with it (e.g., gene read counts, exon read counts, TPMs)
  That Dataset is linked in turn to the RNA extracts (represented by DATS Materials) that were sequenced 
  and analyzed as part of the RNA-Seq analysis protocol.

data/datasets/TOPMed_phs000946_wgs_public.json
  A single DATS JSON file that represents the parent TOPMed Dataset. Each TOPMed study is represented as a 
  sub-Dataset of the top-level TOPMed Dataset. For one of the studies, phs000946.v3, a sample encoding for
  a single subject and DNA extract/sample is provided, based on the public dbGaP variable summary data.
  In order to obtain the DATS JSON for protected metadata it is necessary to download the Python code
  and run the DATS conversion script on both the public and protected metadata files for phs000946.v3.
