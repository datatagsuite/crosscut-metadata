v0.5 Release Notes

This is the v0.5 release of the KC7 crosscut metadata model instance for the following datasets:

   -GTEx v7 public RNA-Seq metadata from the GTEx Portal and dbGaP study phs000424.v7.p2
   -TOPMed public metadata from dbGaP studies phs001024.v3.p1, phs000951.v2.p2, and phs000179.v5.p2

The Python scripts used to generate this release may also be run on dbGAP access-restricted metadata 
for the three TOPMed studies (phs001024.v3.p1, phs000951.v2.p2, and phs000179.v5.p2) and one 
GTEx study (phs000424.v7.p2), in which case they will produce DATS JSON-LD for the actual (meta)data.
Any file produced in this way will contain restricted-access sample and subject phenotype information, 
and therefore cannot be freely distributed.

The public dbGaP-based instances are generated by using the public dbGaP variable summaries to 
produce a single "dummy" subject and sample in which attribute values are chosen according to which 
occurs most commonly in the data (or the median for numeric values.) This produces synthetic data and
may result in nonsensical combinations of attribute values, but has the advantage that it produces 
a metadata instance that is syntactically correct and may be freely distributed.

Also note that the DATS JSON-LD files have been validated against the latest (as of this writing)
version of DATS from

https://github.com/datatagsuite

using the validator in

https://github.com/datatagsuite/dats-tools. 

This repository contains an extension of DATS that is specific to this project and the crosscut metadata
model instance JSON-LD files will NOT necessarily validate against the current DATS release found at
https://github.com/biocaddie/WG3-MetadataSpecifications.

For more information on the crosscut metadata model and the DATS JSON-LD encoding please see the 
README.md at https://github.com/dcppc/crosscut-metadata
