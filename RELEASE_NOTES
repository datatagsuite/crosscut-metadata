v0.1 Release Notes

This release is a KC7 internal-only release of the KC7 crosscut metadata model for GTEx v7 public RNA-Seq metadata.
Note that although the DATS JSON files have been validated against the JSON schemas in the master branch of 
https://github.com/biocaddie/WG3-MetadataSpecifications, they will NOT validate against the current (v2.2) DATS
release. This is a preview release for internal consumption only and it is subject to change.

The following files can be found in the BDBag:

data/docs/ChangeLog       
  ChangeLog for the crosscut metadata model.

data/docs/RELEASE_NOTES  
  A copy of this file.

data/datasets/rnaseq.json
  A single DATS JSON file that represents the parent RNA-Seq Dataset (for the public GTEx v7 data only) and 
  the individual sub-Datasets/data files associated with it (e.g., gene read counts, exon read counts, TPMs)

data/samples/*.json
  One DATS JSON file for each RNA-Seq sample in the public GTEx v7 Dataset. In this release each RNA-Seq
  sample (represented as a DATS Material object) is provided as a separate JSON file. In future releases
  it is likely that these individual sample files will be combined with the rnaseq.json file that contains
  the Dataset-level information. For example, the top-level RNA-Seq Dataset could contain an "isAbout" 
  attribute that lists all 11,688 Materials in this directory.
